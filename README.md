# BargainBot

This project details the development of a Proof of Concept in the form of a Python prototype named BargainBotÂ©. This bot evaluates any shopping list, considers the desired number of stores, then identifies the cheapest stores and lists the products for each.

To gain insights into the data, various analyses were also performed using R. Factors such as quality, labels, package size, origin, or store location were deliberately not considered for this prototype. However, these would be interesting additions for a future implementation. Furthermore, for feasibility and comparability, this prototype relies on a heavily reduced product catalog.
